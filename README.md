# Web-Dev-Final-Project
This is the final assignment for COMP 2681 - Web Site Design and Development

Project description as set by TRU:

Purpose/Objective

This project is designed to give you the opportunity to apply the skills you develop in this course by creating a demonstration website that addresses some needs of a non-profit organization or small business of your choice. (You are not contacting a real business but instead are building the website based on their potential needs and the criteria listed below). Most organizations or businesses have a web presence to promote their products and services, and attract customers. Since an organization/business may have varying website needs, there are set criteria that need to be met for the purpose of successfully completing this project. You can use this website as a demonstration of your skills in an online portfolio, but first, you need to submit a project proposal to your Open Learning Faculty Member.
Proposal

After reading this full project document, briefly describe the nature of a business that you are proposing to create the web site for. Include the features and layout you plan to incorporate in the new website in one or two short paragraphs. Upload your proposal using Moodle in the Project Proposal area instead of email. Your Open Learning Faculty Member will provide feedback about whether your business is appropriate for your project. You will need this feedback before starting your project.
Factors for Success

Some critical factors for success to keep in mind include the following:

    A positive attitude about learning by doing. This is the single most important factor. If you believe that you can learn web design like you learn history (i.e., by listening to someone talk or by reading a book), then you will likely miss critical aspects of web design only attained by actively DOING it. Nonetheless, you need to understand the appropriate terminology and approaches to doing, so a combination of learning by doing and reading is important.

    Willingness to explore, especially online. Just about everything you need to create a successful product can be found on the Web. There are examples you can reference, graphics you can download, and more. If you are not motivated to explore, you will likely hand in a mediocre product. This course will help guide you to initial resources.

Goals

This project’s goal is to help you to improve in a number of areas:

Communication

    Develop verbal, listening, writing, and reading skills.

Research

    Develop information on an actual organization.

    Use the Internet, resource books, and other research techniques.

Positive Professional Attitude

    Demonstrate an understanding of a company’s needs.

    Work to meet established goals.

Work Ethic

    Schedule time and resources to meet timelines.

Creativity

    Use a broad scope of creativity in modeling a business and generating an application.

Business Skills

    Gain insight into a functioning business operation.

    Complete a prototype as part of your portfolio, ready to present to a real business.

    Simulate a process similar to that of a consultant.

    Focus on simplicity, functionality, and ease of navigation within the site as they are key and critical factors to be kept in mind when completing this project.

Problem Solving and Troubleshooting

    Isolate and solve application problems in code, design, and development.

Monitoring Your Progress

You should create a timeline for the completion of the various activities toward the completion of this project. Keep a copy displayed somewhere where you can regularly monitor and review it. The effectiveness of your plan will determine the proficiency and success of your completion of the web project.

A warning about a common planning pitfall is that in software application development, minor tasks may require extensions in deadlines. Over the course of your project work, those delays in deadlines can turn into serious time problems. Monitor your progress frequently to prevent this from happening. Time management is key and fundamental. Waiting and procrastinating until the eleventh hour is going to greatly affect the quality of your web project. Consider the following resources if you would like to know more about time management.

Deliverables

The following is a list of the deliverables required for this project:

    Small business web site

        Overall development/design including layout and responsiveness will be evaluated.

        From this website’s homepage, include a link to the cross-reference page. Ensure the website’s homepage is named index.html

    Cross-reference Page

    At the completion of the small business website, you will include a web page that links to all requirements to aid in the marking of your website. Now is a good time to begin that page by creating a list of all requirements, and when completed, link it to the project website.

        Each item on the cross-reference page must be a hyperlink to the associated item within the website and include a description of what the link is going to show. Your website must demonstrate the appropriate, relevant, and functional use of each of the required features.

        The cross-reference page must be accessible from the home page of the small business website. It must be part of the project website. The cross-reference page should be the last thing to be completed by you. Add the link to the extreme right of your navigational menu.

        Note: If submitting a copy of the completed web project to the business or organization, remove the link to the cross-reference page. The link to the cross-reference page is only required for the copy of the web project that is submitted for marking purposes.

    The cross-reference page should include the following:

    2.1 Nine Websites

    Nine websites in total are required from nine different domains, as listed below.

        Three websites—Similar in business nature to your site

        Three websites—Downloadable sites

        Links to three sites from which you can download free components for use in your project website for the business (i.e., graphics, sound files, etc.). Give a one-sentence description of what you like about each site.

        Three websites—Technical information

        Links to three sites for technicalinformation on technologies you’ll be using for the project website you build for the business. (i.e., HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, etc.). Give a one-sentence description of what you like about each site.

            Any other appropriate relevant documentation pertaining to your site that you wish to include

        Flow of Web Pages. It is important for you to develop a flow of the website. The flow essentially refers to how a user will navigate through the site—how the pages will link to each other.
